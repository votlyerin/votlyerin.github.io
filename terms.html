Votly Terms of Service
Last Updated: February 9, 2026

1. Acceptance of Terms
By creating an account or using Votly, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access or use the application.

2. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old to use Votly. By using the app, you represent that you meet this age requirement. Users in certain jurisdictions may require parental consent if they are under the age of majority.

3. User Accounts & Data
Account Responsibility: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your social login credentials.

Accuracy: You agree to provide accurate demographic information (Age, Location, etc.) during onboarding to ensure the integrity of our community "Vibes".

Termination: We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that provide false information or violate our safety guidelines.

4. User-Generated Content (Dilemmas)
License: You retain ownership of the photos and text you upload. However, by posting a Dilemma, you grant Votly a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to display and distribute that content to other users for voting and research purposes.

Prohibited Content: You are strictly prohibited from uploading content that is pornographic, violent, gore-filled, or illegal. All images are scanned by AI filters (Sightengine) upon upload.

Reporting: Users can report Dilemmas that they find inappropriate. We reserve the right to remove any content at our sole discretion.

5. The Credit System & Gamification
Nature of Credits: Credits are a virtual in-app currency used to post Dilemmas. They are earned through active participation (voting) and have no real-world monetary value. They cannot be redeemed for cash or transferred between accounts.

No Manipulation: Any attempt to use bots, scripts, or multiple accounts to artificially inflate vote counts or "farm" credits is a violation of these terms and will result in a permanent ban.

6. Disclaimers & Liability
"As-Is" Basis: Votly is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.

Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, Votly and its creators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.
