    <h1>Votly Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading or using Votly, you agree to these terms. Votly is a social decision-making tool designed to allow users to create and vote on "Dilemmas."</p>

    <h2>2. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for the content (images and text) you post. By posting "Dilemmas," you grant Votly a non-exclusive license to display this content to other users for the purpose of voting and community interaction.</p>

    <h2>3. Content Standards & Safety</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> You may not post illegal, offensive, or inappropriate imagery. We use automated moderation tools and reCAPTCHA to maintain a safe environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> We reserve the right to remove any content or ban accounts that violate these standards to keep the Tastemaker community safe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. The Credit System</h2>
    <p>Votly uses a non-monetary Credit System to reward engagement. Credits are earned by voting on others' dilemmas and can be used to post your own. These credits have no cash value and cannot be transferred outside the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>You can stop using the service and delete your account at any time. We reserve the right to suspend access for users who manipulate the voting system or bypass security measures.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Votly is provided "as is." We are not responsible for any decisions made by users based on the outcomes of their Dilemma votes.</p>
